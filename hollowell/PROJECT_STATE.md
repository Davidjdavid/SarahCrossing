# HOLLOWELL: Project State

_Last updated: 2026-11-09 (session 1, day 1, late)._

## Status
**Acts I to III done; Act IV under way: the north gate, the Loomwood, the Loom (D8, the Shears) and cutting townsfolk
free are in.** All eight tools exist. Tests cover every room; scripted playthrough legs run from a fresh game to the
end of D7; the Makings, Reveal 2, the Loom and cutting free have their own solution tests.

## Done
- Brief recorded verbatim (GAME_BRIEF.md).
- Design, spoilers, world map, dungeon plan.
- Four-hourly check-in scheduled (trigger `trig_01RDdWnsj7kTWV96cSykoTdq`, cron `7 */4 * * *` UTC, fires
  into this session).

## Done (engine and slice)
- Engine: fixed-step loop, input (keys, pad, virtual), canvas with whole-number scaling, bitmap font,
  sprites from pixel grids, painted tiles per theme with autotiling, areas from ASCII, the Return (marks,
  traces with loop erasure, patience, shoving by weight, snap home, falls/sinks, shards), the player (push,
  pull, grip, lift, throw, stick, falls and flights home along Wren's own trace, hops off ledges), camera with
  rooms, generator scripts, dialogue with choices, HUD, toasts, banners, title, naming, pause menu (satchel,
  map, journal, options, save), saves (3 slots + codes, migrate), chiptune synth and music, debug panel and
  the HW test API with an autopilot.
- Content: hub, 11 interiors, prologue, ceremony, townsfolk talk, Meadowfold, D1 complete; Kilnridge and D2
  complete (charms, seals, eyelets, the Hookline, the Glazer, the Kilnwyrm). Presets `afterD1`, `afterD2`
  (`src/79_presets.js`) start a game at those points; `afterD3`, `afterD4` too.

## In progress
- The ending: cutting Wren's own thread at the fog, the Drift (blank map, nothing returns, Linnet's cottage), the
  Great Pull, the Great Spool (final dungeon, six Knot-locks), the Unwinding, epilogue, credits, the title change.

## Next priorities
1. The ending (above).
2. Optional dungeons O1 (the Stray House) and O2 (the Unfinished House); the remaining secrets; S11's seed planted.
3. Reviews of the Makings/Reveal 2 and the Loom; music and art passes; a full QA pass.

## Known bugs
- Busts look a little like chess pawns (art).
- A creature can stand where a block needs to go; the player has to shoo it (works, but worth watching).
- Enemies don't show their threads (by design for now).
