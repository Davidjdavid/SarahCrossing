# HOLLOWELL: QA Report

## Procedures
- `cd hollowell && npm test`: builds `play.html`, then runs the headless suite (Node `vm` running the real
  game code without a canvas): the Return rules, save/load round trips, every room's scripted solution,
  progression presets, and the scripted full playthrough when it exists.
- `npm run test:browser`: Playwright + Chromium opens `play.html`, starts a new game, plays scripted
  segments, checks for console errors and takes screenshots into `tests/shots/` for visual review.
- Debug: open `play.html?debug` → F1 opens the debug panel (warp, presets, give tools, flags, noclip, show
  traces and collision, fast forward). `window.HW` is the test API.
